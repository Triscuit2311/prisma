# Prisma
Prisma aims to be a simple color theory utility. It will provide color theory tools for palette generation, convertions, etc. Far from complete.

## Why
It's a fun project, and I'm using it to learn Go.

## CLI
This is the primary functional goal. I made the Web UI First to make it easier to make sure my color theory is correct.

## Web Ui
